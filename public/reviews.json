      "review": "Don’t have the luxury to buy the original one as of yet so I tried the 5ml one. I smell the sprayer every now and then. However, my wife didn’t like it and it apparently smelled like “ator” to her. So I would suggest before investing on such expensive unique fragnance, buy a small version and then be sure of it!",

      "review": "I got this along with the Armaf Shades of Blue, and while the latter has become a favourite, I think the Davidoff Cool Water has a more universal appeal. More people will like that cool soapy hint. I think it’s a perfect scent for the summer as the peppermint, amber and orange blossom notes hit really well.",

      "review": "Best budget friendly perfume. Some people tagged it by ‘value for money’ and some ‘blind buy worth’. There’s no doubt about authenticity. For more information about this perfume please check some reviews on YouTube and Fragrantica also. Jazak Allahu Khairan (May Allah reward you)",
